My favorite story in this semester is "Salt"(Alexie, n.d.). This is a story of an intern in a newspaper company who happend to write an obiturity writer's obiturity and to succeed her duty. As part of his job, he met a lady with serious dementia, who believed she could revive her deceased husband and pet by salt. He thought at the end of the story "Jesus, I don’t want to die today or tomorrow, but I don’t want to live forever"(Alexie, n.d., para.212). The story vividly describes different stages of life; youth, middle age, old age, and death. As my youth is comming to its end and my parents are getting old, so the fear the intern felt is so real to me too. At the same time, this story portrait death with respect and humor. For example, the deceased obiturity writer once wrote by mistake "Mr. X is surveyed by his family and friends" instead of "Mr. X is survived by his family and friends", and the widow found it poetic and was happy with it (Alexie, n.d., 16). The widow's witty response made the writer's mistake very humorous. Such wit and humor make this story very enjoyable to read even though death is the story's main theme.
