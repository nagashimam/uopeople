To be honest I didn't learn a lot in this course since most of the contents are about what I learned in my previous college whoose official language is English. Instead, while I work on assignments, I tried out different workflows and tools I haven't used before. Especially neovim editor and bibtex seem to work for me. In the future courses, they will help me work on assignments efficiently and focus on learning the materials.
