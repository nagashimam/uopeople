My thesis:

Every web service should secure web accessibility regardless of its target users. This is because web accessibility benefits everyone including those without disability, it's mandatory by law in some countries, and not securing it is a huge reputation risk. 


Quotes or parapharases from peer-revied sources:

"Many  of  the  strategies  and  solutions developed for accessibility directly benefit users with situational limitations" \citep{UniversalWeb}

The Department of Justice in the U.S was required to enforce Americans with Disabilities Act and to set rules that are compliant with the act \citep{DOJ}.

Inaccessibility to a web service is a huge obstacle for social inclusion, and corporate leaders have duties to make their web products accessible to all \citep{EnterpriseWeb}.
