Every web service should secure web accessibility regardless of its target users. This is because web accessibility benefits everyone including those without disability, it’s mandatory by law in some countries, and not securing it is huge reputation risk. This essay will discuss each point one by one. Discussions below will lead to the conclusion that web accessibility is not just an add-on for disabled people but is a must-have for all web services.

First of all, the definition of web accessibility according to Web Accessibility Initiative(2022) is that "websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them." For example, blind people can use a software called "screen reader" to hear what is on the website, if its contents are built properly. (For readers who are interested in how a screen reader works, watch a YouTube video uploaded by Google(Google Chrome Developers,2016)). More examples are listed on Web Accessibility Initiative(2022) and MDN(2022), but they seem to have nothing to do with people who have no disability. However, according to Henry et al. (2014), ”(m)any of the strategies and solutions developed for accessibility directly benefit users with situational limitations” (p.2). Such examples include captions for videos. Captions don't only allow deaf people to understand the contents, but also benefit hearing people in a loud environment. As Web Accessibility Initiative(2022) puts it, web accessibility is "essential for people with disabilities and useful for everyone".

Web accessibility isn't just useful but is also legally required in some countries. One such country is the U.S. The Department of Justice(DOJ) in the U.S was required to enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act and to set rules that are compliant with the act (Reindl and Manek, 2016). Advocate groups and litigants started filing lawsutes againt inaccessible web products as a result of DOJ's proceeding. For instance, a pizza company Domino's Pizza was sued for violating the act because a blind person cannot order on their website. The court ordered the company to make its website accessible and pay compensation to the blind person(Alcántara, 2021). E.U also has a similar law called the European Accessibility Act. Just like in the case of Domino's pizza, businesses that violate this act have to fix their issues and pay penalties(European Disability Forum, 2020). Neglecting web accessibility of a web service effectively means automatically losing its market share in those countries.

Even if web accessibility is not mandatory where a service is run, being inaccessbile to a web service is a huge obstacle to social inclusion, and corporate leaders have duties to make their web products accessible to all (Gon ̧calves et al., 2013).  Neglectiong the duty could mean the companies lose the trust of thier users. One of such companies is Japan Post Bank. A tweet by their deaf user went viral in Japan in 2021. This says he/she could not use the bank because its authentication system relies on making a phone call to its user. This tweet was retweeted roughly 40,000 times(ＧＯ＠Deaf, 2021). Bad things about any service will be spread all around the world in this age of social media. This tweet proves web accessibility is no exception. Lack of accessibility consideration can damage a business's public image.

This essay has discussed why web accessibility is imperative to all web services. Neglecting web accessibility makes services less convenient for some and unusable for others. Also, it is a serious legal and reputational risk. Each business, regardless of its intended target, has to take web accessibility seriously and secure it in its services.
